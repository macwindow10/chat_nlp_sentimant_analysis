Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:46 pm ,Sehrish,"Hey, have you ever thought about offering prayers regularly? I've been trying to incorporate it into my daily routine, and it's been quite fulfilling.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:48 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,U r absolutely right 👍,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:49 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,Performing the prayers is the command of Allah,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:49 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,"The sincere and devoted prayer helps a person to enter the Paradise, and it is the key to everything good. In fact, the benefits of prayer are numerous, both in this world and the Hereafter; its benefits are spiritual, moral, physical, individual, and social",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:51 pm ,Sehrish,"Of course! Well, I began by setting aside a specific time each day for prayer. For me, mornings work best because it sets a positive tone for the rest of the day. I find it helpful to find a quiet and peaceful space where I can focus without distractions.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:53 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,That's great 👍,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:53 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,"Those who perform the prayer enjoy clean bodies, clean clothes, and a clean environment. In Addition, prayer is to be performed on appointed times. The regular performers of prayer learn punctuality in all their affairs and get a sense of how valuable time is.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:55 pm ,Mahnoor Sikandar,Many of us have experienced a time in our life when we have fallen out with a friend or family member and have not spoken to them for a while because of things that were said. Most often these arguments last a very short time and we soon make up our differences and carry on as normal.,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:55 pm ,Ramsha,"That’s great to hear! I’ve actually been contemplating the idea of prayer too. I’ve always found it interesting, but I’m not sure how to get started. Can you tell me more about your experiencee",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:56 pm ,Sehrish,"Of course! Well, I began by setting aside a specific time each day for prayer. For me, mornings work best because it sets a positive tone for the rest of the day. I find it helpful to find a quiet and peaceful space where I can focus without distractions.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:56 pm ,Ramsha,That sounds like a good approach. I’ll try to find a suitable time and place for myself as well. What do you usually do during your prayer time?,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:57 pm ,Sehrish,"I start by taking a few deep breaths to calm my mind and center myself. Then, I express gratitude for the blessings in my life and reflect on the things I'm grateful for. It helps me appreciate the good things around me and puts any challenges into perspective",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,12:58 pm ,Ramsha,Expressing gratitude sounds like a wonderful way to start. I’ll make sure to incorporate that into my routine as well. Is there anything else you do during your prayers?,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:00 pm ,Sehrish,This message was deleted,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:14 pm ,Sehrish,"Yes, I also take some time to reflect on my intentions and goals. It helps me clarify what's important to me and what I want to focus on. I use that time to ask for guidance, strength, and wisdom in pursuing those goals.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:17 pm ,Ramsha,That’s interesting. I can see how prayer can provide clarity and a sense of purpose. Is there a specific way you address your prayers?,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:17 pm ,Sehrish,"Well, I believe prayer is a personal and individual experience, so there isn't a fixed way to address it. I speak from my heart, using my own words. Some people prefer using established prayers or mantras, while others prefer a more spontaneous approach. It's really about finding what resonates with you.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:18 pm ,Ramsha,That makes sense. I appreciate the flexibility in prayer. It allows for personal expression and connection. I think I’ll try starting with my own words and see how it goes. Do you have any other suggestions or tips for someone who’s just beginning?,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:18 pm ,Sehrish,"Absolutely! It's important to approach prayer with an open mind and heart, and not be too hard on yourself if your mind wanders or if you have doubts. Prayer is a practice, and like any practice, it takes time to develop. So be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:18 pm ,Ramsha,hank you for your guidance and encouragement. I’m inspired to begin my own prayer journey now. I’ll start with a simple routine and build from there. I’m excited to see where it takes me.,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:19 pm ,Sehrish,"That's wonderful! Remember, I'm here to support you along the way. If you ever have any questions or need someone to share your experiences with, feel free to reach out. Let's support each other in our spiritual growth.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:19 pm ,Ramsha,"I appreciate that. Having a friend to share this journey with will definitely make it more meaningful. Thanks again for your guidance, and let’s embark on this new chapter together!",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:28 pm ,Sehrish,have you ever wondered about the significance of cleanliness in Islam?,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:29 pm ,Ramsha,Absolutely! Islam emphasizes cleanliness in various aspects of our lives. It’s not just about physical cleanliness but also spiritual and environmental cleanliness.,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:29 pm ,Sehrish,"That's true. Islam teaches us that cleanliness is a part of faith. It is considered a prerequisite for performing many acts of worship, such as Salah (prayer) and Hajj (pilgrimage).",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:29 pm ,Ramsha,"Yes, exactly. Before performing Salah, Muslims are required to perform ablution (Wudu), which involves washing specific body parts in a specific order. It symbolizes physical and spiritual purification before standing before Allah.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:29 pm ,Sehrish,"And even before entering the mosque, we are encouraged to be in a state of cleanliness. We should brush our teeth, use Miswak (tooth-stick), and wear clean clothes. It helps create an atmosphere of purity and serenity within the place of worship.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:30 pm ,Ramsha,"Islam also emphasizes cleanliness in our personal hygiene. We are encouraged to take regular showers, keep our nails trimmed, and maintain cleanliness in our clothing and surroundings. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of cleanliness in many of his teachings.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:30 pm ,Sehrish,This message was deleted,
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:32 pm ,Sehrish,"That's a great point. Islam promotes a holistic approach to cleanliness, encompassing physical, spiritual, and environmental aspects. By practicing cleanliness, we not only maintain good hygiene but also cultivate a sense of discipline, mindfulness, and respect for ourselves and others.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:32 pm ,Ramsha,"Absolutely, cleanliness in Islam is not just limited to the outward appearance but also extends to the inward purity of the soul. It’s a way of life that encourages us to maintain a harmonious balance between our physical, spiritual, and environmental well-being.",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:33 pm ,Sehrish,"Well said! Let's strive to implement these teachings in our daily lives and promote cleanliness in all its forms, following the beautiful guidance of Islam",
Wednesday,12/7/2023,1:33 pm ,Ramsha,"Definitely! By doing so, we can not only enhance our own spiritual growth but also contribute to a cleaner, healthier, and more harmonious society. May Allah guide us in our pursuit of cleanliness in all aspects of our lives.",
